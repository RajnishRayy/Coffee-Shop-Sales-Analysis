The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the Coffee Shop.

I have downloaded raw data of the coffee shop and loaded it into power query editor, then i transformed the data added some some column for better analysis then i loaded the data to the data model and created various
pivot tables and then i created different graphs for sales and performance analysis.

The coffee shop gave us some questions that i have tried to answer through the dashboard.
